2. User Score has no impact over User Counts.

3. Better the User Score and Critic Score is, better will be the sales globally.

4. Mature Rated games are most sold and critically acclaimed.

5. The relation between Critic Score and Critic Count decreases and gets weaker with new releases over the year.

6. E10+ Rated titles are most popular in terms of Global Sales and Critic Score.

7. PC has the titles with better proportion of Rating than any other Platform.

8. Mature Rating is only suited best for Role playing and Action genre games.



## Key Insights for Presentation

First I introduced all the qualitative variables as a part of Univariate Exploration. I tried to use all the properties of a chart which could reduce Chart Junk and increas Ink-Data Ratio.

While plotting quantitative data over plot, I tranformed axis with the help of log tranformation. Then re-polished them with appropriate ticks and labels. Since there was no oridnal type data here. Establishing relation was bit difficult. My slide presentation contains 24 questions, with proper answers and visualzation as proof.
